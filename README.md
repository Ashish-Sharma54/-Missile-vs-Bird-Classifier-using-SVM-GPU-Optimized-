# -Missile-vs-Bird-Classifier-using-SVM-GPU-Optimized-
Welcome to an advanced, hardware-accelerated, real-time missile vs bird classification system, specially built for aerial surveillance and defense. This project leverages classical SVM classification, image preprocessing (fog removal, grayscale), and is optimized for GPU deployment.
